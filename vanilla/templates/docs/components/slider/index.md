# Slider (Component)

# Overview

A slider provides visual interaction for the user to make a selection from a specified range of values. The user can move the handle to select a value or enter it in the input field.

# Anatomy

![alt_text](/vanilla/templates/static/images/image3.png "image_tooltip")

# Usage

### When to use

* To let users select a value from a fixed range
* To let the user adjust settings or filters
* When an exac

  t value is not needed, but rather an approximate value.
* As a visual aid on infographics and/or graphics. 

### When not to use

* Avoid using a slider if an exact value is necessary, or if using, make the numeric input available.
* If the range is very wide it will be hard to select a specific value. Again, if using a slider, consider making the 

  numeric input available.
* Avoid using a slider for ranges that are very small.

## The look (Live demo box) \[Do not include on discourse post]

* Modifiers:

  * Label - yes/no

  * Input - yes/no
* State:

  * Default

## Behaviour

### Interaction

The user can interact with the slider by dragging the handle along the track or by clicking on a specific point in the track. When a numeric input is present, the user can interact with the slider by writing a specific value.

### Disabled

When the slider is disabled it will have a transparency of 50% and will not be interactable.
